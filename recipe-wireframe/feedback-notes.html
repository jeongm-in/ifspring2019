                For instructions part, maybe have the pictures on top of each instruction.
                This gives more room for your actual instructions, which is what the user cares about.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Because I do not intend to put much text for each step, I chose to align instruction and image side by side.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But once I run out of space or text becomes too cluttered at any point, I will change the alingment.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Maybe for each instruction, you don't necessarily need to repeat the ingredients again. 
                Especially when you have bullet columns in an already two column display.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Yes, I realized repeating ingredients would be redundant and make the steps cluttered.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
