                For instructions part, maybe have the pictures on top of each instruction.
                This gives more room for your actual instructions, which is what the user cares about.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maybe for each instruction, you don't necessarily need to repeat the ingredients again. 
                Especially when you have bullet columns in an already two column display.
