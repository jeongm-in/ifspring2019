            1. Make your recipe directions larger because it's a little hard to read
        </p>
        <p>

            2. Everything else looks good! Maybe make your pictures a little larger? I think the first one is a good
            size and the other ones are a little smaller.
        </p>
        <p>

            3. Check your capitalization throughout the recipe and make sure it's consistent (sometimes you capitalize
            two words and sometimes only one)
        </p>

            1. Definitely make font larger, especially the instructions under each picture.
        </p>
        <p>

            2. Maybe make the margins between each ingredient bigger and the checkbox larger. People with bigger hands
            might have a hard time clicking the check box.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. It's really cool you made it and had your own pictures. Makes the recipe a lot more real and relatable.

            so biggest problem would be the font size. I agree the font size for instructions are rather small.
        </p>
        <p>

            Using screen-width based font size might be a better option here, because phones all have different screen
            size.
        </p>
        <p>

            Another point was capitalization, which hurts the consistency.
        </p>
        <p>

            For "small checkbox," I think I can wrap all the ingredients in an invisible, full-width div and then let it
            clickable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Giving label tag display:block attribute and then setting its width might be another way to tackle this
            problem.
        </p>
        <p>

            Also I realized I could safely increase the picture size.
        </p>
