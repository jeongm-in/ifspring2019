                    <li>
                        I am specifically interested in Front-end web development.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I wish to learn more about design principles and factors.<br><br>
                    </li>
                </ul>


            </li>
            <li>
                Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell me a bit about it.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I took a web development course in Computer Sciences department (CSE330), which covers
                        HTML/CSS/PHP/JS and
                        some frameworks like react.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This semester I am working as a teaching assistant for that course. <br><br>
                    </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When I was taking the above mentioned class and building my own websites, I could not tell
                        whether
                        my
                        design
                        decisions were acceptable or efficient in practice.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I would like to learn more about proper design for better user experience and aesthetics. <br><br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Designing for screen is different from designing for paper because developers and designers
                        should
                        take
                        into account all the different screen resolutions and web compatibilities.<br><br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice. <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://bookandbedtokyo.com/en/" target="_blank">Book and Bed Tokyo</a><br>
                        <!-- some weird vibe? list of answers, one is the link, and the rest are links -->
                        <!-- nested another layer deeper might be effective? -->

                        <li>
                            Website for a hostel in Japan. I ran into this site while I was looking for a place to
                            study
                            during
                            my
                            visit to Tokyo.<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I liked the color scheme, typography and the overall image to text ratio, and I ended up
                            staying here.<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Although hostel itself was not too great (it was a "capsule hotel"), the overall experience
                            was positive.<br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/infrastructure/" target="_blank">Google Cloud

                            This site provides virtual tour with animations and interactive site navigation, and user
                            can
                            visualize how the Google's server infrastructure works.<br><br>

                            A website created by one of my classmates that easily converts your course schedule to a
                            Google
                            calendar schedule. Easy to use, works well, and practical.<br>
