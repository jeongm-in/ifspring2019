        Feedback to Kyla

    <h3>Aesthetic</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>Is the design beautiful/striking/remarkable? </li>
        <li>Does the design aesthetic relate to the concept? </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Yes, all three images contain text with picture of Chandler.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Do the imagery and design choices support the text? </li>
        <ul>
            <li>All three images show what kind of person Chandler is.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Is the aesthetic consistent? </li>
        <ul>
            <li>The portrait layout of the second and third images have Chandler centered in the middle, but in the
                first image Chandler is skewed to the right.</li>
            <li>So perhaps centering Chandler in all three images might give more consistency.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Is the aesthetic driving the concept, or vice-versa? </li>
        <li>Is it legible?, Are type size/color/face/treatment choices helping or hurting? </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Font used in the text is a bit diffuclt to read, especially in portraint layout.
            </li>
            <li>either adding text shadows or changing the font would improve legibility.</li>
            <li>"- Chandler, Bing" part is bit too small to read.</li>

        </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Structure </h3>
    <ul>

        <li>What are the designâ€™s visual priorities? </li>

        <li>Are design elements working in contrast, complement, or conflict? </li>
        <ul>
            <li>In the landscape layout of the third image, part of the text is placed on top of bright background so it
                is a bit difficult to read.</li>
            <li>Adding text shadow or blurring out the background of the text would be a possible solution.</li>
            <li>Especially since in the first image Chandler is wearing a bright colored clothe, some contrast should be
                applied to improve legibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>What elements do you consider foreground? Background? </li>
        <ul>
            <li>picture would be background, and text would be foreground.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>How will the design accommodate variability in browser width? </li>
        <ul>
            <li>The images have plenty of spaces, so moving text around with different browser widths would not be
                difficult.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Is transparency, if used, used appropriately? </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technical Challenges </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>What happens at all of the sizes in between the desktop and mobile versions that have been provided?</li>
        <li>At what point does text collide with imagery? At what point does contrast affect legibility? </li>
        <ul>
            <li>At this point the layouts are images with text written on it, so I was unable to test different sizes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Are images presented with sufficient resolution, and without unintentional distortion or compression
            artifacts? </li>
        <ul>
            <li>images are a bit low resolution, so maybe replacing them with better resolution would improve
                legibility.</li>

            <li>Especially for landscape layouts, I think the current images would be blurred out in high-definition
                screens.</li>

        </ul>
        <li>Have image edges all been considered and managed? </li>
        <ul>
            <li>image edges were not managed, but since Chandler is mostly centered in the image, managing the border
                would not affect the contents of the postcard.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Will elements such as fonts transfer as intended to the browser environment? </li>

        <li>Can you build it? </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Although the layouts are solid images at this point, building a responsive website would not be too
                difficult.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
